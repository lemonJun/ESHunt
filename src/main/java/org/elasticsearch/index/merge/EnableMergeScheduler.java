 * to have merges disabled.

 * This merge scheduler can be used to get around the fact that even though a merge
 * policy can control that no new merges will be created as a result of a segment flush
 * (during indexing operation for example), the {@link #merge(org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter, org.apache.lucene.index.MergeTrigger, boolean)}
